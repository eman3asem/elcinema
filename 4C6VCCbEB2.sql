This new character helped sustain him while he was attending university in Cairo and living away from his parents. Thus, the bold character that had come to characterize him helped him to live alone and to take decisions independently.\nHe originally intended to enroll in the faculty of engineering but due to the fact that his test scores were only two points shy of the admission cut-off, he would enroll instead in the architecture division of the faculty of fine arts. He had a miserable time there as he felt lacking after years of superior academic performance in his previous academic stages.\nIn his second year, he decided to travel to the United States in order to seek new experiences there.
